                        <h2>I Don't Know How I'll Feel When I'm Dead, But I Don't Want To Regret The Way I Lived.</h2>
                        <p>Idly indulging in baseless paranormal activities with the Occult Club, high schooler Yuuji
                            Itadori
                            spends
                            his days at either the clubroom or the hospital, where he visits his bedridden grandfather.
                        </p>
                        <p>However,
                            this leisurely lifestyle soon takes a turn for the strange when he unknowingly encounters a
                            cursed
                            item.</p>
                        <p> Triggering a chain of supernatural occurrences, Yuuji finds himself suddenly thrust into the
                            world
                            of
                            Curses—dreadful beings formed from human malice and negativity—after swallowing the said
                            item,
                            revealed
                            to be a finger belonging to the demon Sukuna Ryoumen, the King of Curses.</p>
                        <p>Yuuji experiences first-hand the threat these Curses pose to society as he discovers his own
                            newfound
                            powers.</p>
                        <p>Introduced to the Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School, he begins to walk down a
                            path
                            from
                            which he cannot return—the path of a Jujutsu sorcerer.</p>

                                Yuuji, a first-year student at Tokyo Metropolitan Curse Technical College, is a muscular
                                teenager with big light brown eyes and light brown spiky hair. After becoming a host for
                                Sukuna, a small line appeared below each of his eyes.
                            </p>

                                Yuuji is a fair person who cares greatly for not only his comrades, but anyone he views
                                as
                                people with their own wills, despite how deep or shallow his connection to them is. He
                                cares
                                greatly for the "value of a life" and to this end he will ensure that others receive a

                                death." He is easy to anger in the face of pure cruelty and unfair judgement of other
                                people.

                            <p>
                                Known as the undisputed King of Curses (呪いの王), Sukuna, according to legend, was a demon
                                (though in truth was a human Sorcerer) during the prime era of Sorcery 1000 years ago,
                                and
                                Sorcerers gave their all to defeat him. After his death, his corpse was unable to be
                                fully
                                destroyed, and thenceforth his remains of 20 fingers, preserved in grave wax, traversed
                                the
                                ages as Cursed Objects. In the present, Sukuna was incarnated into Yuuji Itadori due to
                                the
                                latter eating one of his cursed fingers, which contain his fragmented power.
